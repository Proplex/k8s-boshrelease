description: |
  An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that
  containers are running in a pod.

  The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various
  mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are
  running and healthy. The kubelet doesnâ€™t manage containers which were not
  created by Kubernetes.

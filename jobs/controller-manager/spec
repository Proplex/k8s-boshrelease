  Component on the master that runs controllers .

  Logically, each controller is a separate process, but to reduce
  complexity, they are all compiled into a single binary and run in a single
  process.

  These controllers include:

    - Node Controller: Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go
      down.

    - Replication Controller: Responsible for maintaining the correct number
      of pods for every replication controller object in the system.

    - Endpoints Controller: Populates the Endpoints object (that is, joins
      Services & Pods).

    - Service Account & Token Controllers: Create default accounts and API
      access tokens for new namespaces.
